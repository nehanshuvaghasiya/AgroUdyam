# ðŸ”§ CORS Error Fix

## What Was Changed

Updated backend CORS configuration to allow multiple frontend origins:
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:3001
- http://localhost:3002
- Any custom FRONTEND_URL from .env

## Why This Was Needed

Next.js automatically tries different ports if 3000 is busy:
- First tries: 3000
- If busy tries: 3001
- If busy tries: 3002

The old CORS config only allowed port 3000, causing CORS errors on other ports.

## How to Restart Backend

After updating CORS, restart your backend server:

```bash
cd backend
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## Testing CORS

You should now be able to register/login from any of these URLs:
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:3001
- http://localhost:3002

## If You Still Get CORS Errors

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

2. **Check Backend Console**: Look for "CORS blocked origin:" messages

3. **Verify Backend is Running**: Visit http://localhost:8081/health

4. **Check Frontend Port**: Look at your browser URL bar

5. **Add More Origins**: Edit `backend/src/app.js` and add your port to the `allowedOrigins` array

## Backend Console Output

You should see successful requests without CORS errors:
```
POST /api/v1/auth/register 200 - 145ms
POST /api/v1/auth/login 200 - 95ms
```

If you see "CORS blocked origin:", add that origin to the allowedOrigins array.
